# R2 **Retrieval–Reranker**

This repository provides the framework for **Retrieval–Reranker: A Two–Stage Pipeline for Knowledge Graph Completion**. 

We propose the use of Rerankers for Link Prediction to enhance the accuracy of top-k predictions. Rerankers, commonly employed in Information Retrieval, refine candidate rankings by rescoring subsets of predictions. Building on this concept, we develop a Reranker model using traditional machine learning techniques combined with ensemble learning to integrate multiple classifiers. This approach rescored top-k predictions generated by embedding models, significantly improving link prediction outcomes.

### Datasets

The repository includes subfolders for three well-known benchmark datasets:
- **DBpedia50**
- **FB15k-237**
- **WN18RR**

Each dataset folder contains the required data and precomputed embeddings and negative samples created to train the ensemble model.

### Reranker Notebooks

For each dataset, two Jupyter notebooks demonstrate how to apply the reranking process:
- `*_distmult_reranker.ipynb`: Uses DistMult embeddings.
- `*_transe_reranker.ipynb`: Uses TransE embeddings.

These notebooks illustrate:
1. Loading entity and relation embeddings.
2. Generating positive and negative samples for training.
3. Training Ensemble Model.
4. Using Reranker for Link Prediction Pipeline.

### Utility Code

`link_prediction.py` provides shared functions and classes, including:
- Loading triples and embeddings.
- Generating negative samples.
- Computing evaluation metrics (e.g., hits@k).
- Streamlining the reranking workflow.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Requirements**:  
   Ensure you have Python, Jupyter, and the required libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `tqdm`).

2. **Run a Notebook**:  
   Launch a Jupyter server and open one of the `_reranker.ipynb` notebooks. Follow the steps inside to rerank predictions and view metrics.

3. **Customize & Extend**:  
   Adapt the code to other datasets or embedding models by:
   - Placing your dataset and embedding files in a new folder.
   - Creating a new notebook that imports and uses `link_prediction.py`.
